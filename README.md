# ProjectEuler_CPP

Currently rewriting all of my solutions before continuing from 88.

This is a repository for showcasing my Project Euler solutions writtin in C++. Publicly my solutions will only appear up to 100, to be within the Project Euler post rules. I will update this file to display what solution number I am on after the first 100 are solved.

My rules for my code is as follows:
1. All solutions must be mine. Obviously if I use a well known algorithm like a quicksort, I am not claiming it as my original creation.
2. All solutions must run in less than 1 minute.
3. All solutions can use standard C++ imports, anything not supplied by C++ will be made custom.
